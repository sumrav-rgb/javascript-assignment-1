Q1.What is innerHTML?
innerHTML is a property of DOM elements that allows you to read or modify the HTML content inside that element. You can use it to see what's currently inside an element, or to replace it with new HTML content. It's one of the most common ways to dynamically update what users see on a webpage.


Q2.What is DOM?
DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML documents. When a webpage loads, the browser converts your HTML into a tree-like structure called the DOM. This structure treats every element (like divs, paragraphs, buttons) as objects that JavaScript can find and manipulate. It's basically the bridge between your HTML page and JavaScript code.
